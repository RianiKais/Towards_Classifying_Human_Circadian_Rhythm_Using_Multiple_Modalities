# Towards_Classifying_Human_Circadian_Rhythm_Using_Multiple_Modalities

Abstract—Autonomous vehicles represent one of the most active technologies currently being developed, with research
areas addressing, among others, the modeling of the states and behavioral elements of the occupants. This paper contributes
to this line of research by studying the circadian rhythm of individuals using a novel multimodal dataset of 36 subjects
consisting of five information channels. These channels include visual, thermal, physiological, linguistic, and background data.
Moreover, we propose a framework to explore whether the circadian rhythm can be modeled without continuous monitoring
and investigate the hypothesis that multimodal features have a greater propensity for improved performance using data points
specific to certain times during the day. Our analysis shows that multimodal fusion can lead to an accuracy of up to 77% on
identifying energized and enervated states of the participants. Our findings highlight the validity of our hypothesis and present
a novel approach for future research.
